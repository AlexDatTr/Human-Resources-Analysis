# Human Resources Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Human Resources (HR) data, aiming to provide actionable insights into various aspects of employee management. The analysis covers topics such as employee turnover, performance evaluation, and workforce diversity, utilizing a range of data analytics and visualization techniques.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze HR-related data to identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing employee behavior and organizational outcomes. By leveraging data, we can make informed decisions that contribute to the improvement of HR processes and employee satisfaction.

A key feature of this project is the development of an interactive Human Resources Dashboard. Given the dataset's similarity to those used by many HR management systems (HRMS) on the market, the Power BI dashboard can be easily adapted for business use with minimal fine-tuning and data transformation.
